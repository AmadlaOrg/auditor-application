# `auditor-application` 🕵
🕵 Auditor for Application 🕵

This auditor determines if an application, package, and/or container image is installed.

It also informs on if the application, package, and/or container image exist on a container hub or package manager
server even if it is not on the local machine.

## What are auditors?
It is a simple command line application. It could be made out of any programming language. What makes an auditor/plugin
is that it informs what it supports and supports a or multiple entities data structure. But the data can be passed via
a `--data|-d` parameter or via a pipe `|` (stdin).

> More information on auditors/plugins can be found in [`judge`](https://github.com/AmadlaOrg/judge) README and
> `./.docs/`.

## 🐰 Amadla
Auditors like this one don't require [Amadla 🐰](https://amadla.org/) to function, but it requires a specific data
structure. The data structures that it supports are found the [Entity Supported](#-entity-supported) list section. The
data in entities are stored in [YAML](https://yaml.org/) ([HERY](https://github.com/AmadlaOrg/hery)) format but need to
be pass in [JSON](https://www.json.org/) format.

Every auditor/plugin to [`judge`](https://github.com/AmadlaOrg/judge) require to inform what it supports. So when
executing this application with the param `amadla` it will output a [JSON](https://www.json.org/) with information on
the version of [`judge`](https://github.com/AmadlaOrg/judge) or any other tools it supports and entities it supports.

> Side note: If working in bash with JSON is required, the tool [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) might be of great
> help.

Example:
```bash
auditor-application amadla
```

The default display is with a table:
```
+--------------+----------------------------------------+-------------------+
|   CATEGORY   |               SUPPORTED                | VERSION SUPPORTED |
+--------------+----------------------------------------+-------------------+
| applications | hery                                   | ^0                |
| applications | judge                                  | ^0                |
| entities     | github.com/AmadlaOrg/EntityApplication | ^v1.0.0           |
+--------------+----------------------------------------+-------------------+
```


Output:
```json
{
  "supported": {
    "judge": {
      "version": "^0"
    },
    "amadla": {
      "entities": [
        "github.com/AmadlaOrg/EntityApplication"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### To output to a file
```bash
auditor-application amadla -j 2>&1 | tee output.json
```
